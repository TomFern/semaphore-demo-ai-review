# DIY AI Code Review With OpenAI and Semaphore

Do AI reviews **directly** using an inference endpoint ‚Äî no pricey tools needed.
This repo shows how to run a **code-review gate** in CI with a few Bash lines and an AI API.

* üß© **Works in CI** (Semaphore)
* üß† **Your rules** (security/style/perf‚Ä¶ you decide)
* üì¶ **Structured output** (JUnit XML) ‚Üí shows in test results
* üí∏ **Low cost** (you control what gets sent & how much)

## How it works

* Collects up to *N* files from the PR (you can filter by extension or path)
* Builds a compact payload (truncate large files to control cost)
* Calls the AI endpoint with a prompt like:

  > ‚ÄúYou are a senior code reviewer. Review these files for security, performance, and maintainability. **Respond only with valid JUnit XML.**‚Äù
* Extracts the model‚Äôs text output and saves it to `review.xml`

> If you prefer JSON, ask for JSON and convert to JUnit in the script. JUnit is convenient because CI already knows how to display it.

## Prerequisites

* A Semaphore project wired to this repo
* An AI endpoint + API key (e.g., OpenAI Responses API)

---

## Quick start (Semaphore)

1. Fork this repo
2. Add project to Semaphore
3. Add a secret with the API Token
   In *Project Settings ‚Üí Secrets*, create `OPENAI_API_KEY`
4. Push code or create a PR
   Open a pull request that changes a small file under `src/`.
   The job will:

   * collect changed files
   * call the AI endpoint
   * write `review.xml`
   * publish it as a job artifact
